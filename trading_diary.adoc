Week Ended 24 July 2014
-----------------------

This was a fairly grim week. The portfolio exposure has been reduced to
below £400K, in terms of margin and well below £300K in terms of VaR on
a 4-day horizon with 99.9% probability and a Monte-Carlo VAR Scenario.

The exposure is tipped to Europe, in the hope that we’d finally escape
from the drag created by the never-ending Greek crisis. Sadly a few
other events have conspired to drag down equity markets: * Terrible news
from China, where the authorities seem determine to rig the markets by
banning short selling and using government funds to prop up the market,
* Good claims numbers from the USA, but so-so results from Dow Jones
constituent companies, particularly Caterpillar, * Rising USD prices,
driven by increasing talk about rate rises in the US this year from
Janet Yellen, * Marginally less than perfect results form Apple, *
Collapses of the price of commodities and mining companies as the full
realization of how much malinvestment has been sunk into mines lately
sinks in.

Monday 27 July
--------------

The market seems fixated on the weakness of the Chinese economy, and, by
extension that of the rest of the planet. Many Chinese stocks have gone
limit down. I have tentatively bought one lot of XINA50, since a 9.3%
decline in a day is surely excessive. I have also increased my exposure
to ACWI by 2.5%. The only stocks that have withstood the onslaught are
CIU and VNQ. I am showing losses on my short positions in GBL and ZN
(and, to a lesser extent, R), but, interestingly BTP is showing a small
decline, offering me minuscule gains on my short BTP position.

The BTP effect shows that credit concerns for Italy slighly overwhelms
the effect of inflation expectations. I pruned the position by one
contract.

HG and HSI are being slaughtered, both on Chinese weakness. Transports
(DTX) is not doing so badly. This seems a very odd market reaction given
the relatively strong employment numbers at the end of last week.

I was down 1% on the day, which shows that I was not very well hedged
against equity movements. My overall exposure is 90% of my equity, so
it’s not surprising that my portfolio performed like this, with such a
broad sell-off in equities. Equities have sold off around 3% over the
last week. I am holding on for a bounce tomorrow!

Mark Haefele of UBS has
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0f52ef40-2c8d-11e5-acfb-cbd2e1c81cca.html#axzz3h5korLPr[a
Market Insight piece] that says that the US economy will not recover
until companies start increasing capital expenditure. My view is that
this is a temporary phenomenon linked to the weakness of oil and gas
prices which is inhibiting investment in production and exploration.

There is
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d35822a0-324d-11e5-8873-775ba7c2ea3d.html[an
interesing article] that says that biotech is seriously overvalued.
Certainly there is a possibility of a rotation from growth to value
stocks as we (hopefully) emerge from stagnation. Shorting IBB is
certainly a way to hedge the overall long equity exposure. Growth stocks
have been so strong since 2008 I am reluctant to go too far.

I closed out my XINA50 position. China is a very foreign country, and I
just don’t have the resources to tell if it is fairly valued, or, if
that question is meaningful in a market that is so rigged by the
authorities.

Everyone seems to be waiting for the Fed Meeting to take place today and
tomorrow. I assume there is some kind of statement.

The euro has been very strong lately, but I feel that this is just mean
reversion after the dollar shot up in anticipation of a rate rise in the
Autumn.

At 16:30 UK time the portfolio is up 0.5%. This is a modest bounce from
the lows of yesterday, but it does not feel like the start of a bull
market. The modest short bond element of the portfolio (about 20%)
doesn’t help very much as it is amplifying the swings when the market
gets panicky. I need to reduce the US equity element, I think, as I’m
getting nervous about the dominance of growth stocks in the SP500.

Wednesday 29 July
-----------------

Things are settling down nicely. Portfolio up 0.5% at 18:40. Fed statement on rates today. I don't know what was said, but it seems to have gone down well: SPX up 0.46%. 

IBB is down 1.82%: beginners luck, but I have only a small (short) position, so I'll keep it.

ZN down 0.23%, consistent with Fed statement implying early rate rises. GBL, R also down (unsurprisingly) but to my great relief, BTP down. BTP has been moving against GBL, lately. It is a nice surprise to see it coming into line, although my position is now pretty small, so it doesn't mean much to me in pound terms.

AMLP has been 

Seems that Fed announcement was not much of a shock, since DX barely moved.

Thursday 30 July
----------------


At 11:20, Major indexes up, AAA bonds up. Dollar flat. 

At 17:14, most equity indexes down, ACWI down 0.32%. Portfolio showing a decline of 2.3bp (0.023%). Basically a flat day. ESTX up .3%, so I'm glad a I bought one extra lot.

VaR now sitting at 6.2%. Acceptable, but would like to get it to 5% of portfolio value. The ACWI position now accounts for one third of the VaR. 

Decided to close the IBB position. This strategy needs to be examined later, in more detail.

Finally my limit order to sell MXEA at 1872 was triggered. Unfortunately I'd sold one lot earlier, so I ended up with a one-lot short position. Not a lot of 
damage was done, bit I should have adjused the limit order.
This released margin of about 0.5% of the portfolio value (and about 12.5% of the previous margin). I then extended the position by buying some ETFs. Mainly VTI, 
which has a wonderfully low expense ratio, but also EFA, which is the ETF equivalent of MXEA.

I have now pushed the VaR expected maximum loss to 5% of the portfolio value, which is a comfortable level that could be increased to take advantage of a rebound from a major market
movement.

Europe was up a lot earlier this morning, and I just wondered whether I should get exposure via DJ600 (the full 600 stock future) rather than the STOXX 50. 
In general my attitude is always '`the bigger the number of stocks in the index the better`', as long as I don't have to pay much for the privilege.

I also felt that having 100% GBP currency exposure was possibly bad. I therefore bought some USD. This reduced by margin exposure.

The market moved against me in the afternoon: ACWI down .18%, but I managed to reshuffle my exposure without realizing any losses. 
Not sure what is driving the market down: EEM seems very weak, so maybe its yet more bad news coming out of China.

Tuesday 4 August
----------------
Got cold feet yesterday and transmitted a couple of sell orders to reign back the position. 
Because of the early rally in European equities I'd bought some MXEA, but this slumped later in the day.
To reduce the overall risk of the position I put in a sell order which was triggered this morning. 
I also decided to undo my newly increased exposure to USD. 
It's really not good practice to get cold feet within a day of trading, but fortunately I was able to reverse these trades at no cost.

Current max loss (VaR) standing at less than 4% of portfolio equity, which is as low as it has been for a long time. 
The summer, and the general uncertainty around China, Greece, US employment, UK recovery, Abenomics and the Fed raising rates all make me want to reduce my exposure.
Current daily movements trending to around the 10bp level, which is really just noise. 
To be fair, though, the markets are quite quiet too.
