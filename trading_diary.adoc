== Week Ended 24 July 2015

This was a fairly grim week. The portfolio exposure has been reduced to
below £400K, in terms of margin and well below £300K in terms of VaR on
a 4-day horizon with 99.9% probability and a Monte-Carlo VAR Scenario.

The exposure is tipped to Europe, in the hope that we’d finally escape
from the drag created by the never-ending Greek crisis. Sadly a few
other events have conspired to drag down equity markets: 

* Terrible news from China, where the authorities seem determine to rig the markets by
banning short selling and using government funds to prop up the market,
* Good claims numbers from the USA, but so-so results from Dow Jones
constituent companies, particularly Caterpillar, 
* Rising USD prices,
driven by increasing talk about rate rises in the US this year from
Janet Yellen, 
* Marginally less than perfect results form Apple, 
* Collapses of the price of commodities and mining companies as the full
realization of how much malinvestment has been sunk into mines lately
sinks in.

== Monday 27 July

The market seems fixated on the weakness of the Chinese economy, and, by
extension that of the rest of the planet. Many Chinese stocks have gone
limit down. I have tentatively bought one lot of XINA50, since a 9.3%
decline in a day is surely excessive. I have also increased my exposure
to ACWI by 2.5%. The only stocks that have withstood the onslaught are
CIU and VNQ. I am showing losses on my short positions in GBL and ZN
(and, to a lesser extent, R), but, interestingly BTP is showing a small
decline, offering me minuscule gains on my short BTP position.

The BTP effect shows that credit concerns for Italy slighly overwhelms
the effect of inflation expectations. I pruned the position by one
contract.

HG and HSI are being slaughtered, both on Chinese weakness. Transports
(DTX) is not doing so badly. This seems a very odd market reaction given
the relatively strong employment numbers at the end of last week.

I was down 1% on the day, which shows that I was not very well hedged
against equity movements. My overall exposure is 90% of my equity, so
it’s not surprising that my portfolio performed like this, with such a
broad sell-off in equities. 
Equities have dropped by around three percent over the last week. I am holding on for a bounce tomorrow!

Mark Haefele of UBS has
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0f52ef40-2c8d-11e5-acfb-cbd2e1c81cca.html#axzz3h5korLPr[a
Market Insight piece] that says that the US economy will not recover
until companies start increasing capital expenditure. My view is that
this is a temporary phenomenon linked to the weakness of oil and gas
prices which is inhibiting investment in production and exploration.

There is

stocks as we (hopefully) emerge from stagnation. Shorting IBB is
certainly a way to hedge the overall long equity exposure. Growth stocks
have been so strong since 2008 I am reluctant to go too far.

I closed out my XINA50 position. China is a very foreign country, and I
just don’t have the resources to tell if it is fairly valued, or, if
that question is meaningful in a market that is so rigged by the
authorities.

Everyone seems to be waiting for the Fed Meeting to take place today and
tomorrow. I assume there is some kind of statement.

The euro has been very strong lately, but I feel that this is just mean
reversion after the dollar shot up in anticipation of a rate rise in the
Autumn.

At 16:30 UK time the portfolio is up 0.5%. This is a modest bounce from
the lows of yesterday, but it does not feel like the start of a bull
market. The modest short bond element of the portfolio (about 20%)
doesn’t help very much as it is amplifying the swings when the market
gets panicky. I need to reduce the US equity element, I think, as I’m
getting nervous about the dominance of growth stocks in the SP500.

== Wednesday 29 July

Things are settling down nicely. Portfolio up 0.5% at 18:40. Fed statement on rates today. I don't know what was said, but it seems to have gone down well: SPX up 0.46%. 

IBB is down 1.82%: beginners luck, but I have only a small (short) position, so I'll keep it.

ZN down 0.23%, consistent with Fed statement implying early rate rises. GBL, R also down (unsurprisingly) but to my great relief, BTP down. BTP has been moving against GBL, lately. It is a nice surprise to see it coming into line, although my position is now pretty small, so it doesn't mean much to me in pound terms.


Seems that Fed announcement was not much of a shock, since DX barely moved.

== Thursday 30 July


At 11:20, Major indexes up, AAA bonds up. Dollar flat. 

At 17:14, most equity indexes down, ACWI down 0.32%. Portfolio showing a decline of 2.3bp (0.023%). Basically a flat day. ESTX up .3%, so I'm glad a I bought one extra lot.

VaR now sitting at 6.2%. Acceptable, but would like to get it to 5% of portfolio value. The ACWI position now accounts for one third of the VaR. 

Decided to close the IBB position. This strategy needs to be examined later, in more detail.

== Friday 31 July

Finally my limit order to sell MXEA at 1872 was triggered. Unfortunately I'd sold one lot earlier, so I ended up with a one-lot short position. Not a lot of 
damage was done, bit I should have adjused the limit order.
This released margin of about 0.5% of the portfolio value (and about 12.5% of the previous margin). I then extended the position by buying some ETFs. Mainly VTI, 
which has a wonderfully low expense ratio, but also EFA, which is the ETF equivalent of MXEA.

I have now pushed the VaR expected maximum loss to 5% of the portfolio value, which is a comfortable level that could be increased to take advantage of a rebound from a major market
movement.

== August
=== Monday 3 Aug
Europe was up a lot earlier this morning, and I just wondered whether I should get exposure via DJ600 (the full 600 stock future) rather than the STOXX 50. 
In general my attitude is always '`the bigger the number of stocks in the index the better`', as long as I don't have to pay much for the privilege.

I also felt that having 100% GBP currency exposure was possibly bad. I therefore bought some USD. This reduced by margin exposure.

The market moved against me in the afternoon: ACWI down .18%, but I managed to reshuffle my exposure without realizing any losses. 
Not sure what is driving the market down: EEM seems very weak, so maybe its yet more bad news coming out of China.

'''''
=== Tuesday 4 August
Got cold feet yesterday and transmitted a couple of sell orders to reign back the position. 
Because of the early rally in European equities I'd bought some MXEA, but this slumped later in the day.
To reduce the overall risk of the position I put in a sell order which was triggered this morning. 
I also decided to undo my newly increased exposure to USD. 
It's really not good practice to get cold feet within a day of trading, but fortunately I was able to reverse these trades at no cost.

Current max loss (VaR) standing at less than 4% of portfolio equity, which is as low as it has been for a long time. 
The summer, and the general uncertainty around China, Greece, US employment, UK recovery, Abenomics and the Fed raising rates all make me want to reduce my exposure.
Current daily movements trending to around the 10bp level, which is really just noise. 
To be fair, though, the markets are quite quiet too.


'''''
=== Wednesday 5 Aug
Equity markets rose strongly early, for reasons which seem to be connected with a light private payrolls number.  
This is supposed to delay the point when the Fed will raise rates.
Bonds (GBL, R, ZN and BTP) were all down between about a half a percent and one percent.

Equities fell back later in the day. 

I took the advantage to take profits on a couple of positions, lowering my VaR to the lowest it has been for months. The only equity futures position I have now is OBX, which I probably should never have bought: it seems to trade only ever couple of days.

=== Weekending 8th Aug

The end of the week was pretty disappointing. The payroll numbers were pretty much as expected: 215K, but the market didn't like them. 
It's not really clear whether the problem is that 'the market expects' interest rates to increase because of the strength of the economy, or the stock market to decline, because of the weakness of the economy.

Commodities are going through a 'nuclear winter' as Dividend Disco says. At some point, things will have to improve, and with that in mind I've opened up a small position in VDE.
As usual when the market is drifting lower, I could not resist picking up some favourite stocks at a cheap(er) price.
My main splurge was on ten contracts of ES, which is, in the new cautious trading regime, a big postion for me. 
// Must adjust to express in pc of portfolio terms 

I was tempted to punt on TSLA, which I regard as a faintly ridiculous company. I shorted 6.2% of my position, which is, in retrospect, quite brave. 
The position was closed out via a saved limit order at the open on Monday at a modest profit, but I really must stick to my guns and avoid individual stocks.
'''''

=== Monday 10 Aug

On Monday the market rallied. 
I yielded to temptation again to put on some extra exposure to the equities market 'now that the bearish phase is finally over'.  Purchases of VNQ, AMLP, DJ600 Sept, REM, VDE and BRK B. 

As the (US) morning wore on the day got better and better. 

Currently I'm getting away with it. Total VaR loss still only 222K, so I haven't gone mad.

=== Tuesday 18 Aug

Well, the market has resolutely drifted sideways.

I am up on the week, but only by 0.5%, so I probably should have stayed out of the market.

I did the accounts for the pension fund, of which my brokerage account forms the bulk of the assets, and was pleased to find
that I'd made an (unrepeatable) 75% return (annualized, continuously compounded) over first half of the calendar year. 
Although this information should have no influence on my investment decisions, it did tell me that a lot is possible to make
seriously strong returns when the market, globally is going sideways.

Ironically I cannot really remember how I did it. Checking the market every day, seeing a significant number of days when the 
portfolio is down significantly means that you end up losing track of the performance overall. 
For Q1 and Q2 this was particularly a problem as I was transferring all my holdings from Options Xpress to Interactive Brokers.
After using USD as a base currency for a while (because that was what I was used to with Options Xpress, where you don't
have a choice about what base currency to use) I switched to pounds, which is, after all, what all my costs are denominated in.
Because the numbers were similar I really missed the fact that I was up a lot, in USD. 
I believe my main gains were obtained by having faith in Europe and using options a lot.

I am not running any options positions now because this requires more day-to-day monitoring of my positions than I have time for, and anyway, volatility is too low. 
I was mainly shorting puts in order to express a bullish view and receive option premium.

I do feel that USD is the place to be at  the moment. 
The consensus seems to be building that the Fed will indeed raise rates next month, which, presumably will at least ensure that the dollar is supported. 

EEM has been a terrible investment. Even though it's only 2.2% of the portfolio I deeply regret opening it.

Trading ideas (not implemented): short MYR, short anything to do with China, short anything to do with Russia and Brazil. The BRICS have become the fragile five (or ten, or fifteen!).

I decided to short the RUB and CNH. Emerging market currencies have had a rough time recently, because of weakness in commodity prices. The yuan is a rigged market, so anything could happen, but now the PBOC have allowed it to devalue once, and claimed the reason is to let its level be more determined by market forces, it seems logicall that for all sorts of reasons it will sink. 
China is a semi kleptocracy, and although it has made great economic gains recently as it adopts western
technology I do no think that it will ever transition to a first world country unless it becomes a democracy, which seems as unlikely an event as ever now.

Russia is rapidly becoming a failed state. It went straight from communist dictatorship to kleptocrat dictatorship, and will not exit that state without a major crisis.

== October 15

There are tentative signs that Europe's economy is starting to take off. Mario Draghi seems to have overcome the opposition from the Bundesbank to buy government bonds. Far from generating hyperinflation, however, interest rates in Europe, both short and long term, have never been lower. Most of the continent has negative short term rates, which, until it happened, was thought to be impossible. 

The way to take advantage of this situation is to enter into a spread trade, selling Bunds, and buying US Treasuries.  The theory is that buy being net flat in ten-year exposure, the strategy will be immune from global interest rate fluctuations.

The theory worked well for most of a month, before yields in Germany fell even lower. This was pretty painful, and has damaged my recent performance, but I still consider that the strategy is sound, and will not be unwinding my position any time soon.

Unfortunately, margin calculations do not give me full credit for the hedge as Bund futures trade on DTB and US Treasury futures trade on CME (or Globex). I am nowhere near using all my capital for margin, so that's not a major problem, but it is a bit annoying.
