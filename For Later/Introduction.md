# Intro

You have to have a reasonable amount of capital to make it worth reading this book, if you measure the benefits in purely financial terms. If you have only a hundred pounds to invest, the extra return you make is simply not going to cover the opportunity cost of reading this book, let alone the cost of buying it. However, you never know when you might come into money, and you can at least sound financially well-informed to your friends, even if you are broke.

## Why Invest?

Production is carried out to satisfy needs. Of course we have needs that cannot be produced in a factory, or on a farm. But from an economic point of view, production happens so that we may consume the product of consumption. Some production produces benefits that may be enjoyed over a prolonged time: a bridge or a road. Some production, such as a music concert, just for the moment. But in both cases, so we can enjoy consuming what is produced.

The timings of our consumption and production may not synchronize well, which leads us to save, and sometimes to borrow, to allow our pattern of consumption to be better timed.

We may wish to consume more education or durable goods early in our lives, to enjoy benefits later.  
We may wish to save some of what we produce in our prime for our old age.  
We may wish to save for some specific future event: having children, going on holiday, buying a house.

All these give rise to different time horizons for our savings, and to different tolerances for risk.  
Quantifying risk is a big subject in the context of investment: possibly the biggest of all, and I shall come back to it. This book focusses mainly on savings over the longer term, by which I mean around ten years or longer. Sometimes a short term requirement for funds can be met by borrowing, but for most individuals there is a big spread between the rate at which they can borrow, and the rate at which they can lend, which means that it's rarely possible to substitute borrowing for liquidation of an investment.

From a strict economic perspective, consumption is what matters, but I think that it's possible to derive a considerable benefit from having savings that are big enough to cover the cost of any 'rainy day' that fortune may throw at us.  
On the other hand, there is no point in saving so much out of one's income that life is a miserable struggle.

Finally, try to avoid being both a saver and a borrower at the same time. In theory there is nothing wrong with borrowing cheaply to invest in higher return assets. However, the higher return has to be paid for with a higher risk, which can become a risk of bankruptcy if one goes too far. The other reason is that financing costs generally cannot be used to offset investment income in the tax system, at least for private investors. Sometimes this latter problem can be averted by investing in a geared underlying asset, but risks remain. For private investors too, the 'spread' between saving and borrowing rates works against this strategy.
