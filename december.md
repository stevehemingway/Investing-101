# December

This month was dire. My main exposure is to european stocks. 
They continued to sag as concerns over the middle east, Paris bombings,
Daesh, Russian involvement in Syria, Fed tightening, continued disappointing news coming out of China, and weak commodities prices, especially oil and iron, continued to be a daily feature of the news.

I took the view that all this was temporary and I could afford to buy on the dips, but the dips kept on dipping, and I was beginning to feel that the ZeroHedge view of the world was absolutely correct.

I had just read a book _The Complete Investor_ by Tren Griffin, about Charlie Munger, and his ideas about finding intrinsic value and nearly decided that I was doing it all wrong.

Fortunately, the Fed's tightening, which is about to be announced on the 16th seemed to concentrate everyone's minds on about the 14th. The conclusion of the market, tentatively, is that everything is going to be alright.

I am not out of the woods, but prices have strengthened promisingly.

I also bought a chunk of Valeant, (VRX), which did pretty well, but I chicked out on the 15th and closed the position at a decent profit. If I notice it dipping again, I plan to sell.

My reading continues to be eclectic. I read through _The WSJ guide to the 50 Economic Indicators that Really Matter_ by Simon Constable. This was quite an easy and interesting read. It is very handy to read it in conjunction with subscribing to the D Short _Advisor Perspectives_ newsletter, which has graphs and discussions of most of the indicators that are covered.

In terms of investment performance, the main characteristic of the month was volatility. Major indices seem to swing around regularly by more than two percent, which is wildly unlikely for an index which has an annual volatility of around 20%. 

Protecting against volatility by buying options has become almost prohibitively expensive, although I had to buy some deep out of the money puts on European equities, '`just in case`'.

The Fed jump of interest rates seems to have spooked the US and international markets, without sending them in any particular direction. The USD has been quite strong against the GBP, so my hedging of this risk has paid off.

My conviction that at some point this divergency between US treasuries and Bunds will revert has yet to bear fruit, but at least over the last few weeks it hasn't got materially worse. I am in this trade for the long haul. I certainly didn't expect it to be as long as this.

Oil prices continues to plumb new depths. At some point they must hit a bottom, as must other commodities, but miners - and the FTSE - continue to suffer. It seems to me that either (i) oil will hit a bottom, start to rise (or even just remain flat), cause the start of inflation in Europe and my GBL/ZN trade will start to pay off or oil prices will continue to weaken, depressing inflation in Europe, which will spur the ECB to more QE and stimulus, which will boost my EU equities by enough to offset my GBL pain.

It remains baffling to me that stockmarkets rally when oil does. Maybe it's just a 'risk on' flow out of Treasuries which inflates all real assets, but for the vast majority of companies in Europe, oil is a cost. Even the UK, which is most heavily exposed to minerals, has only 5% of the stockmarket cap in miners and extractive industry. I feel I want to go short of oil, just to reduce the swings on my portfolio value, but I cannot bear to short something that has fallen so far, and so fast. Especially when the Middle East continues to look like its in the middle of WW3.

I am writing this on Dec 29. I am currently long DJ600 and ESTX50. Also exposure to individual large markets: Z, FTMIB, CAC40 and IBEX. I am long ZN and short GBL.
