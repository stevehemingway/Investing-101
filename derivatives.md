= Derivatives

Derivatives are meta assets. They are contracts that allow the holder to derive some or all of the economic benefits of owning an asset without actually owning it.  They exist for a variety of reasons:

1. convenience: you can receive dividends as if you were the owner of a share, without having to fill in a stock transfer form, or get your name added to the company's register of shareholders,
2. tax advantages: if you acquire rights to the dividend stream from a share via a CFD you do not need to pay stamp duty, as you would if you purchased the underlying share,
3. gearing: because of the ease of enforcing power of sale over a CFD, compared to an underlying share, using it as collateral to obtain a geared exposure is much easier than it would be than to set up a loan secured on an actual share certificate,
4. flexibility: an option contract allows the holder to benefit from price increases of a share, just as a holder of the cash security would, but without participating in any downside risk of the price of the security going down. Of course, such a beneficial risk profile comes at a price, which has to be paid to the person on the other side of the contract,
5. legal necessity: in many countries, including Britain in the sixties and the USA in the 30's, it was illegal to hold gold bars. The firm IG Index was set up to allow UK investors who felt that an exposure to gold would be a good investment at a time when inflation was starting to erode the value of bonds and cash deposits.

Don't be scared by the idea of derivatives. For many purposes they are just a convenient way to get exposure to an asset that would be expensive or inconvenient to achieve otherwise. Modern brokerages can allow the amateur investor to obtain an exposure to a huge range of assets via derivatives than were remotely possible even for professional investors a few decades ago.

== Introduction

Derivatives have had a bad press in recent years. 
Warren Buffett memorably described them as _weapons of mass financial destruction_. 
Certainly in the wrong hands, they can go very wrong. 
Banks were able to transform messy collections of small loans to dubious borrowers to large denomination bonds, some of which seemed to have the sort of claim on underlying cash flows that rating agencies deemed to merit a 'triple-A' rating. 

My advice is: do not invest in a derivative where the underlying cash instrument is not something that you would be comfortable in having a direct exposure to. Additionally, 


The problem of how to value derivatives is not wholly solved, and probably never will be. 
Progress has been made, however, and a number of Nobel Prizes in Economics have been awarded to the clever mathematicians and finance specialist who have made this progress. 
You will probably be pleased to know that I do not plan to attempt to summarize this work here. A number of books in the bibliography are listed for those who wish to pursue this topic.

Although the theory of derivatives valuation can be daunting, software to calculate 'fair values' is cheap and is often built into the websites of brokers which offer derivatives trading. This is especially true for options, where most progress has been made. 
It is important to realize that these 'fair values' incoporate various assumptions about future price distributions, dividends, interest rates and so on, that are not well known.  

The main point about options trading is that it allows the investor to take a view about future uncertainty, something that is not possible with futures or CFDs. See [the chapter on options trading] for more detail.


Derivatives have a role in amateur investing in the following ways:

1.  obtaining cheap exposure to securities that otherwise would be very
difficult for amateurs to trade, such as copper or pork bellies,
2.  converting income to capital gains, and otherwise to take advantage of differential tax  treatment for different types of profits or gains, (e.g. CFDs)
3. allowing trading at convenient times for an investor based away from the timezone where the underlying is trading (e.g. the XINA50 future, that trades during European and US timezones, on a Chinese equity index underlying),
4. standardizing exposure to a class of assets, such as government bonds, e.g. T Bill futures, where the underlyings have a range of coupons and maturity dates.


== OTC and Exchange-Traded Derivatives

Increasing regulation of public stock exchanges have lead to the
creation of private platforms for trading a range of financial
securities. Public stock exchanges create a lot of value for providers
and consumers of capital. Companies get the best price for their new
issues, investors get the best price for securities they buy. Public
exchanges provide various investor protection services, in terms of
standardization and monitoring. These benefits are large, but when large
compliance costs imposed on those who use a public exchange reach a
threshold level, a private exchange, accessible only by large investors,
becomes a viable competitor. For FX, where there are relatively few
assets, which naturally need minimal standardization or monitoring, the
whole market became `OTC' many years ago. It seems likely that this will
happen more widely in the future.

Exchange-traded derivatives usually benefit from a clearing house
provision, which, for individual investors is indispensible. This means
that no investor is exposed to the credit risk of any other investor:
all trades are with a central counterparty that always executes `back to
back' trades so that it is never left with a net market exposure.

== Futures

Futures allow the investor to gain an exposure to an underlying cheaply
and with very little contaminating risk, particularly if the near month
is traded. Buying a future is like buying the underlying, but giving up
a few months’ income, and pre-paying a few months’ financing cost.
Although a future gives an exposure only until its maturity date, it is
usually very cheap to `roll' the future into the next nearest delivery
month. 

This method can be used to give a long-term exposure to the
underlying, packaged up with the cheapest possible financing. For a
small scale investor, it is extremely important to minimize the cost of
finance. 
CFDs can produce the same exposure, and to a larger range of markets and sectors, but only at a cost of more expensive carry costs.


My own preference is to use futures to gain an exposure to an underlying, if a suitable contract is available. *Some* futures have poor liquidity, and short trading hours, but compared to even main market shares, the spreads are very low.  
It is more easy to get a fine-grained country or region exposure using futures than it is to get sectoral exposure. 
DTB offers contracts on all the sectors which make up the STOXX 600 index of European equities. 
An example of the sorts of sectors you can get an exposure to via futures using this method includes:

* insurance,
* construction and materials,
* chemicals,
* banks,
* travel and leisure.

Unfortunately, you cannot get within-country sector exposure with futures (banks in the UK) or even the more fine-grained exposure you might want (e.g. non-life insurance only). 

CFD/Spread betting providers will allow you to take a view on within-country sector exposure (certainly within the UK), but this is likely to come at a cost. [quantitative estimate based on IG account?]

As ever, there is going to be a tradeoff. A sector future will not have the liquidity of the whole market. For you to be able to buy there must be someone, somewhere, ready and willing to sell. Exchanges exist to allow buyers to find sellers, but sometimes there is just nobody to take the other side of a trade. Automation of trading does not help with this, unless traders abdicate control of their positions to an algorithm. Even if they did, the algorithm might be unwilling to take the other side of your trade.


== Swaps
Swaps are wonderful for switching an exposure to a particular maturity (e.g. 3-month floating rates) to another maturity (e.g. 10 year fixed). They also work well for foreign exchange. 

Institutional traders can trade equity swaps, which do the same sort of thing where one side of the exposure is an index. However, for the individual trader this is really not viable, mainly because to a large extent the sort of exposure switching you could achieve with a swap can be replicated using futures or CFDs.

This situation may change. Many products available only to the most sophisticated professional traders have found their way onto retail platforms over the years, and this may be another one about to be launched onto an unsuspecting public.

== Options

Options are like insurance policies. They pay out when something (more or less) unlikely happens.
In the happy world of securities trading you can not only buy the policy, but write it too. 
It's like having the option to be the bookie or the punter, to draw a parallel with the world of betting.

Basic options are puts and calls. The former pay out if the underlying's price drops below a fixed level. The latter if it exceeds a fixed level. 

=== Example

==== Call Example

If you have an inkling that a bid for Marks and Spencer may be launched in the next month you can buy a put, to allow you to profit if the price shoots up, without committing a lot of capital by buying the underlying, and without being exposed to any downside if the quarterly results are very dissapointing, or the Bank of England unexpectedly hikes interest rates.

If this all sounds too much like a free lunch, it is. You have to pay a premium, not unlike an insurance premium, to get this 'no downside risk' exposure. If the hoped-for bid fails to materialize you've incurred the cost without having anything but an expired policy to show for it.

==== Put Example
You have noticed that there is strong momentum in the S&P 500 index, and you don't want to miss the boat.
However, you notice that on a lot of fundamental valuation measures (market cap to GDP, price to book) the market is looking distinctly overvalued and you fear a large drawdown.

You decide that you will protect against the worst by buying out of the money puts. 
You buy puts which are 30% out of the money.

 of 0.05, or at a certain cost. Refer to the Dao of Investing

== Spread Betting

Spread betting is unique to the UK. Because a CFD-like product can be
wrapped into what is, for tax purposes, a bet where the odds are not
fixed at the point of entering into the bet, they are very favourably
treated for tax purposes. The big problem is that the underlying price
is a price made by the spread betting brokerage, and therefore is not
guaranteed to track the underlying. The other problem is that the
implicit financing cost can be very high. The websites are structured to
encourage high gearing and heavy use of stop orders. Both of these, are,
in my book, tickets to oblivion.

== CFDs

CFDs or `Contracts for Difference' are relatively new products, mainly
aimed at the retail investor. They combine a traded underlying with 100%
finance. They are equivalent to a rolling forward. They have a number of
problems: the financing cost may be high, may be less than transparent,
and may vary according to the size of the position. Having said all
this, a CFD provided by a good brokerage, such as \{\{ best_brokerage
}}, can provide good, cheap, exposure to and underlying where other
methods would be prohibitive.

== ETFs

ETFs, or Exchange Traded Funds, are a recent development which has
revolutionized investing in the last ten years or so. They are
securities, packaged by large financial houses such as iShares or
Blackrock, which track a huge range of asset classes. They are a huge
bonus for retail investors who want to have fine control on their asset
class exposures and are true believers in the EMH within national
stockmarkets.

ETFs are of two kinds. * Physical ETFs are funds which are invested in a
portfolio which tracks, as closely as possible within cost constraints,
a particular index (often one defined by MSCI). +
* Synthetic ETFs, where the issuer replicates the behaviour of the
underlying using swaps and futures, but guarantees a maximum tracking
error against the published index. [Check this: does the issuer really
guarantee a tracking error, or do you, as the investor, just get what
the issuer manages to achieve using it’s derivatives-based strategy?]

== Foreign Exchange

== Stock Market Index

== Direct holdings of cash equities with margin finance

Most US brokerages will lend against equity as collateral. However, it
is almost never worth taking advantage of this to increase gearing as
the rates available are, in my limited experience, atrocious. Especially
as the maximum gearing is usually very low. It is much better to use
CFDs, which bundle finance with the original trade, or, even better, use
futures, where the counterparty, in effect bundles the financing.
