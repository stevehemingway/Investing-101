## Carry Cost

To understand the net return on a portfolio it is best to imagine creating it ex-nihilo. To acquire assets it is then necessary to borrow, typically by borrowing (shorting) your home currency, or some other funding source. Although people do not always think about equity porfolios this way, it is actually a useful way to think about whether or not an investment really is worth making. It might sound good to hold a share portfolio for a year and show a total return of 10%, but if short-term interest rates are running at 12% it suddenly doesn't sound so smart any more.

## Effecient Market Hypothesis

The idea that the price of a security reflects all publically available information about it at all times.

## Market Risk

Risk arising from the fact that the price of securities in the future is a random variable.

## Mean Reversion

Certain prices have mean reverting behaviour. Yields cannot go up, or down, forever. Reversing a trend, though, can take a long, and variable, time. Example: price (or yield) of a bond, over time. 

## Miller Mogdiliani Theorem

The 'no magic in gearing' theorem. States that, in a slightly idealized world in which there are no taxes on dividends, profits or bond interest. Most practitioners probably think that this is total rubbish, but I rather admire it.

## Open Interest

The number of derivatives contract that have not been closed. E.g. a new futures contract starts trading, you buy 1 contract ('lot'), by entering into a trade with a counterparty who sells you the lot. At this point, if no other trades have taken place, you the open interest for this contract is exactly one.  Open Interest is a _stock_, Volume is a _flow_.

## Position

The stock of securities held by an investor. I.e. your portfolio: the set of things you own. Ownership is used in a legal, but otherwise vague sense. Your position is also known as your holdings: the stuff you own!

## REITS

Real Estate Investment Trust. Tax-privileged corporate structure that gives a relatively pure exposure to developed (completed) commercial and residential real estate.  Residential REITs have various problems to do with tax.

## Volume

Trading volume, amount of stuff changing hands. 

## market price
