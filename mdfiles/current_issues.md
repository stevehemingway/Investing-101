# Trading Strategies

An old boss of mine used to say 'There are no such thing as problems, only opportunities'. I was not convinced about this, but in investing this may well be true: for most assets it's easy to be on either side of the trade, so one man's loss really is another man's gain.

## Death of Inflation

Roger Bootle spotted that, early in the 80's, inflation would subside. This is a familiar, and unremarkable observation now, but at the time it was fairly contentious. The upshot of this was a multi-decade long 'secular' bull market in bonds. Government bonds have given very strong returns in recent decades, to the extent that the 'Cult of Equity' has died, or at is at least in the Intensive Care Unit.
