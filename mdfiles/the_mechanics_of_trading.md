# Valuation

If you buy an asset that is under priced you will make money when it becomes correctly priced. There are two problems with this: arriving at the _correct_ price, and knowing when the market price will revert to it. The assumption that the clearing price is not _correct_ which is problematic. What is even more problematic, is that   the demand and supply shedule will adjust itself in some finite timescale. Somehow.

### Valuation Comparables

#### Market Cap to GDP 

The natural question to ask about whether a market is overpriced is 'compared to what?'.  A lot of valuation metrics arise from various plausible answers to this question. One answer is 'compared to the economy as a whole'. This is, supposedly, a favourite metric of Warren Buffett. It certainly has the advantage of simplicity. The downside is that it does not look at the shift in companies' preferred financing strategies. Over time, and between countries, companies finance their capital spending in different ways. Investors' enthusiasm for equities has resulted in substitution of equity for debt. This certainly happened in the 60's, and is, arguably, happening now. In continental Europe, even large companies choose bank debt over securities and especially over equity, which is regarded as 'Anglo Saxon capitalism'.
