# Week Ended 24 July 2014



This was a fairly grim week. The portfolio exposure has been reduced to below &pound;400K, in terms of margin and well below &pound;300K in terms of VaR on a 4-day horizon with 99.9% probability and a Monte-Carlo VAR Scenario. 

The exposure is tipped to Europe, in the hope that we'd finally escape from the drag created by the never-ending Greek crisis. Sadly a few other events have conspired to drag down equity markets:
*	Terrible news from China, where the authorities seem determine to rig the markets by banning short selling and using government funds to prop up the market,
*	Good claims numbers from the USA, but so-so results from Dow Jones constituent companies, particularly Caterpillar,
*	Rising USD prices, driven by increasing talk about rate rises in the US this year from Janet Yellen,
*	Marginally less than perfect results form Apple,
*	Collapses of the price of commodities and mining companies as the full realization of how much malinvestment has been sunk into mines lately sinks in.

# Monday 27 July

The market seems fixated on the weakness of the Chinese economy, and, by extension that of the rest of the planet. Many Chinese stocks have gone limit down. I have tentatively bought one lot of XINA50, since  a 9.3% decline in a day is surely excessive. I have also increased my exposure to  ACWI by 2.5%. The only stocks that have withstood the onslaught are CIU and VNQ. I am showing losses on my short positions in GBL and ZN (and, to a lesser extent, R), but, interestingly BTP is showing a small decline, offering me minuscule gains on my short BTP position. 

The BTP effect shows that credit concerns for Italy slighly overwhelms the effect of inflation expectations. I pruned the position by one contract.

HG and HSI are being slaughtered, both on Chinese weakness. Transports (DTX) is not doing so badly. This seems a very odd market reaction given the relatively strong employment numbers at the end of last week.	

I was down 1% on the day, which shows that I was not very well hedged against equity movements. My overall exposure is 90% of my equity, so it's not surprising that my portfolio performed like this, with such a broad sell-off in equities. Equities have sold off around 3% over the last week. I am holding on for a bounce tomorrow!

# Tuesday 28 July

Mark Haefele of UBS has [a Market Insight piece](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0f52ef40-2c8d-11e5-acfb-cbd2e1c81cca.html#axzz3h5korLPr) that says that the US economy will not recover until companies start increasing capital expenditure. My view is that this is a temporary phenomenon linked to the weakness of oil and gas prices which is inhibiting investment in production and exploration. 

There is [an interesing article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d35822a0-324d-11e5-8873-775ba7c2ea3d.html) that says that biotech is seriously overvalued. Certainly there is a possibility of a rotation from growth to value stocks as we (hopefully) emerge from stagnation.  Shorting IBB is certainly a way to hedge the overall long equity exposure. Growth stocks have been so strong since 2008 I am reluctant to go too far.

I closed out my XINA50 position. China is a very foreign country, and I just don't have the resources to tell if it is fairly valued, or, if that question is meaningful in a market that is so rigged by the authorities.

Everyone seems to be waiting for the Fed Meeting to take place today and tomorrow. I assume there is some kind of statement.

The euro has been very strong lately, but I feel that this is just mean reversion after the dollar shot up in anticipation of a rate rise in the Autumn.
