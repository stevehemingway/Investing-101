# Week Ended 24 July 2014


This was a fairly grim week. The portfolio exposure has been reduced to below &pound;400K, in terms of margin and well below &pound;300K in terms of VaR on a 4-day horizon with 99.9% probability and a Monte-Carlo VAR Scenario. 

The exposure is tipped to Europe, in the hope that we'd finally escape from the drag created by the never-ending Greek crisis. Sadly a few other events have conspired to drag down equity markets:
*	Terrible news from China, where the authorities seem determine to rig the markets by banning short selling and using government funds to prop up the market,
*	Good claims numbers from the USA, but so-so results from Dow Jones constituent companies, particularly Caterpillar,
*	Rising USD prices, driven by increasing talk about rate rises in the US this year from Janet Yellen,
*	Marginally less than perfect results form Apple,
*	Collapses of the price of commodities and mining companies as the full realization of how much malinvestment has been sunk into mines lately sinks in.
