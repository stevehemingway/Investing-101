# Valuation

If you buy an asset that is under priced you will make money when it becomes correctly priced. There are two problems with this: arriving at the _correct_ price, and knowing when the market price will revert to it. The assumption that the clearing price is not _correct_ which is problematic. What is even more problematic, is that   the demand and supply shedule will adjust itself in some finite timescale. Somehow.
