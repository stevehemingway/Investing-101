# Why I wrote this book

I have worked in and around securities markets for a long time. For the last twenty years I've been investing my own money (and that of some close associates). I have made a lot of mistakes. I have learned a lot of things in the process. My goal in writing this book is to help you avoid these mistakes, and maybe to make some new ones of your own. With any luck they'll be less costly than mine, at least in percentage terms.


I had no intention of writing a book which is a comprehensive overview of how financial markets work. I include in the bibliography a range of my favourites.
