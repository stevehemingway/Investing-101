# Preface

## For the technically minded

The files for this book are kept as git repositories on both github and bitbucket. You can fork my source from either repository!

Most of the actual writing is done on  [http://www.gitbook.com\[gitbook.com](http://www.gitbook.com[gitbook.com)\].   
This is a very neat website that uses [http://www.github.com\[github](http://www.github.com[github)\] as storage.  
However, I can set up a local repository and 'git pull' the source and work to my heart's content on local copy, offline, knowing that I can merge back into the master branch later.

I  using the GitHub service for the actual remote storage of files.  
I'm using the free version, which means that I have no option but to  share my   
work with the world.   
You can view the underling asciidoc files both on GitHub, but use Gitbook for a more friendly interface with the option to export to formats for offline reading \(ebook and pdf\).

As as a backup to the backup, I'm also keeping a copy on [https://bitbucket.com\[bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com[bitbucket)\], which seems to have some significant advantages as a git repository, according to people who understand git much better than I do.

I am not an expert on git. It does seem a much under-used technology, which has applications beyond pure source control for programmers, which is where it started. The combination of it, and ascii-based markup, is, I believe, a great way to write books collaboratively.

### What this book is written in

I have sprinkled the odd equation through the text. In order to make these look good, even if they do not actually illuminate the message very much, I've used latex, for which I've found [http://www.personal.ceu.hu/tex/cookbook.html\[this](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/tex/cookbook.html[this) page of examples\] very helpful.   
Don't be intimidated.   
Just read the words.   
No information is presented only in the equations: they are just to link up this text with more formal accounts.

I originally wrote this in asciidoc, which seems to have a be a better pure-ascii markup language than markdown. Unfortunately, it is far less widely supported, so I returned to the Markdown fold. I have to admit that Typora played a role in persuading me to do so.
