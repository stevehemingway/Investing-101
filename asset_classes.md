# What is an asset?

I think of an asset as something that generates a cashflow at some point in the future. Many assets produce a stream of income, such as equities and bonds, but some, such as commodities produce just one, on their sale[^storage-cost]. 

In this chapter I will restrict myself to 'cash' or 'spot' or 'real' assets: ones which, if you can travel to them, you can kick, or at least handle.

# Equities
# Bonds
# Credit
# Commodities
# Foreign Exchange


[^storage-cost]: Commodities will generate a negative stream of income, as generally there will be a warehousing cost.
