# Commodities and Tradable Securities

This book will concern itself with assets the rights attached to which are sufficiently standardized that their ownership can be transferred without involvement of a lawyer. Generally the rights reduce to the stream of income and, in the case of equities, voting. In practice voting rights are difficult to exercise if exposure is obtained through derivatives and so we are really concerned about assets which generate  a stream of income, of various degrees of uncertainty.

When an asset is sufficiently standardized it can be transferred via an exchange. 

# What is an asset?

I think of an asset as something that generates a cash-flow at some point in the future. Many assets produce a stream of income, such as equities and bonds, but some, such as commodities produce just one, on their sale[^storage-cost]. 

In this chapter I will restrict myself to *cash* or "spot" or "real"  assets: ones which, if you can travel to them, you can kick, or at least handle them, in contrast to derivative assets, which are contracts the price of which depends, in some very general way, on the price 

# Bonds

Bonds are tradable debt securities. Essentially they are standardized loans which can be traded on an exchange.

# Credit

# Equities
# Commodities
# Foreign Exchange
# Real Estate
# Infrastructure



[^storage-cost]: Commodities will generate a negative stream of income, as generally there will be a warehousing cost.
