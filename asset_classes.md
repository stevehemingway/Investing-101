# What is an asset?

I think of an asset as something that generates a cash-flow at some point in the future. Many assets produce a stream of income, such as equities and bonds, but some, such as commodities produce just one, on their sale[^storage-cost]. 

In this chapter I will restrict myself to *cash* or "spot" or "real"  assets: ones which, if you can travel to them, you can kick, or at least handle them, in contrast to derivative assets, which are contracts the price of which depends, in some very general way, on the price 

# Bonds

# Credit
# Equities
# Commodities
# Foreign Exchange
# Real Estate
# Infrastructure



[^storage-cost]: Commodities will generate a negative stream of income, as generally there will be a warehousing cost.
