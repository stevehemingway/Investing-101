# January

My general view is short interest rates, and I was punished in Jan. Things have got better since.

## March

My portfolio as of 10 Mar is:

* 12% copper via HG futures
* 1% European stocks \(DJ600\)
* -26% long-dated US Treasuries \(ZB\)
* -120% 10-year gilts \(R\)
* 6% gold \(via POG CFD\)
* 2.5% UK commercial real estate via LAND
* 2.4% World ex-US equities via EFA CFD

The single idea is that the green dragon of inflation is not slain but merely at the end of a decades long and thoroughly re-invigorating sleep.

In terms of currency exposure, taking into account all the instruments above, plus FX positions, I have:

* 14% EUR
* 86% USD

The general idea is that the US is still on a recovery track, and will be the first economy to tighten rates, with Europe behind. I have roughly zeroed my exposure to GBP, because it is still far from clear what the future has in store for Brexit. Exposures should be taken with a pinch of sand because, for example, a UK CFD presumably is counted as a GBP exposure, even if it is a gold miner based in Russia.

##  Week ending 11 March
The problem child of my portfolio is definitely POG. Gold is suffering from US tightening and a strengthening dollar, and this is pushing down POG, which seems to produced gold at around $1,200 an ounce. The ruble has stablized, so the benefits of reducing costs from currency weakness are, presumably, over.
