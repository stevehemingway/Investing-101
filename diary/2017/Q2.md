# Q2 2017

I am going to write my diary in ascending chronological order from now on. It's easier just to add a new entry at the top, but for the reader, it can't be the right thing!

## April

Current portfolio, after minor tweaking this morning is as follows:

### Fixed Income

* GBL, BTP - Euro govt. bonds
* JGB - Jap govt. bonds
* R - gilts

My general bearish view on bonds, especially UK bonds, the complement of my bearish view on sterling.

### Equity Indexes

Short US equities, via ES.

Long EU equities, via DJ600.

Generally neutral on equities, but with a view that the US is leading, and the EU is lagging in the economic recovery, but will get there in the end.

### Equities

BBY - some company-specific news that suggests that some of BBY's dire troubles are behind it. A major force in UK infrastructure construction, so should have a good demand outlook.

GLEN - has had a near-death experience, followed by a strong recovery. A high-risk company, run by a risk-taker, but in a bombed out sector, which surely is coming back. Also denominated in GBP, but really an international operation, that will benefit from the weakness of sterling.

POG - a play on gold, on Russia, and on the weakness of sterling. Really, too illiquid, and I'm unwinding the position. It did show a large loss. Probably worth having a continued modest exposure, but I won't be averaging down quite so aggressively in the future.

### Commodities

HG - this is a bet on the global economy, especially emerging markets, recovering. Copper has been very weak, but it has so many uses in the modern economy, and is not exposed to any particular geographical source of demand, I feel that it should not be so weak.

### FX

Long EUR.USD - bullish on EUR, because EU following USA out of recession, but this not priced into equities or FX yet.

Long EUR.GBP - bullish on EUR, bearish on GBP, because of Britain's chronic twin deficits.

Short GBP.USD - bearish on GBP, as above. USD has strengthened, but will generally strengthen if the global economy grows, presumably\(!\).

### 4th April

We seem to be in a risk on world. Problems of the US president seem still to be setting the tone for the market. A bomb in St Petersburg yesterday didn't help, although the Russians never seem to make such a big thing about this as we do. I guess all news organizations pay more attention to domestic terrorism than overseas stuff.

The good thing about this is that POG continues to soar. As of this morning, I unwound my whole position, at a modest profit. It seems to be still going up, but now it has an RSI of about 90, I feel that discretion is the better part. It's pretty agonizing to see a security continue going up when you've closed the position, and there is always that temptation to get back in, since it's obviously such a good stock, but discipline is needed in this game.

My short government bond positions all tend to move in lockstep when something bad happens, which can be quite uncomfortable. To take some of the edge off a bond rally, I slightly increased my short S&P 500 position. I read today that speculators are short Russell 2000 futures to an unusual degree, which, I guess, should encourage me. The short equity position is far too small, though, to go very far in offsetting the cost of a rising bond. There is no logic to all this, unless you assume some sort of global conspiracy. \[Mohammed el-Erian\]\([https://www.ft.com/content/ebd96b1c-178f-11e7-9c35-0dd2cb31823a\](https://www.ft.com/content/ebd96b1c-178f-11e7-9c35-0dd2cb31823a%29%29 thinks that yields will have to rise %28_Bond market ignores more assertive Fed at its peril_\).  I am pretty well hedged, and although today is a risk off day, I am showing a profit, although I think my initial profits yesterday were wiped out by the bad news.

Macro news about Spain's unemployment being the lowest for eight years seems to have been ignored completely.

## 6th April

I always keep a few limits in place, at least on my positions I don't have total conviction in. I was short ES on the basis that this would reduce the volatility on my short bond positions. This is the equivalent of being long bonds and long equities in an attempt to diversify risk a bit. However, I am always nervous about shorting the US stock market, even at elevated levels, as it is such an attractive investment for anyone wanting to get an exposure to the global economy. I don't know exactly the figure, but US listed companies now must account for 80% those with a truly global reach, which probably means 80% of companies which are true global monopolies: where there are increasing returns to scale even at the a level of production which is the total level of global consumption. This is particularly so with pure internet plays, where the marginal cost of production stays at zero at any production level. There is no point where selling another copy of Microsoft Word starts to cost Microsoft more on a unit cost basis.

As you should know, I am fairly bullish on the global economy, and had long CL and HG positions. Both commodities have rallied quite a bit of late, and I decided to liquidate these. I always struggle with liquidating a position that is coming into profit. I know that autocorrelation is weak to non-existent in securities prices, so the fact that something has rallied a fair bit lately does not, ultimately, mean that it will not keep doing so.

I decided to liquidate my DJ600 positions too, since it was showing a profit, and once I'd liquidated my ES position, I was no longer naturally hedged against equity volatility. Selling this dropped my margin levels to around 11% of my net equity, and my VaR to about 8% of my equity. This is back to a comfortable level. Equity holdings really are expensive in terms of risk. I feel I can now sleep much more peacefully in my bed.

## 12th April

Now I am down to just bonds and currency, things have got a lot less volatile, which is definitely a good thing. The bad thing though is that perceived instability in the world \(Putin, Zuma, Trump\) together with the continued rise of the anti-globalists \(MÃ©lenchon, Le Pen, Wilders\), continue to boost the price of bonds. Actually, things have been very flat, but the period of sagging bond prices seems to be over for a while.

FX positions are largely unchanged. The pound has had an implausible rally against the dollar. This is probably more a generalized weakness of the dollar caused by the idea that Trump is going to be able to achieve a lot less than he rashly promised.

I have a wholly unjustified idea that price movements before a major public holiday \(Easter\) can be a guide to how the 'smart money' is positioned. The idea is that prop traders don't want to have to scramble to make margin calls when they are relaxing in the Hamptons, so gradually ease their foot off the gas pedal as they go into the holiday, which tends to make prices move against the, even if only slightly. I wonder if anyone has any evidence for this. It is not inconsistent with the 'Sell in May, and go away' aphorism which has been current in the UK for a long time.

If my idea is right, then I should see my positions bounce in value as soon as these masters of the universe return from their vacations.
