# Q2 2017

## April

Current portfolio, after minor tweaking this morning is as follows:

### Fixed Income

* GBL, BTP - Euro govt. bonds
* JGB - Jap govt. bonds
* R - gilts
* 
### Equity Indexes

Short US equities, via ES.

Long EU equities, via DJ600.

### Equities

BBY - some company-specific news that suggests that some of BBY's dire troubles are behind it. A major force in UK infrastructure construction, so should have a good demand outlook.

GLEN - has had a near-death experience, followed by a strong recovery. A high-risk company, run by a risk-taker, but in a bombed out sector, which surely is coming back. Also denominated in GBP, but really an international operation, that will benefit from the weakness of sterling.

POG - a play on gold, on Russia, and on the weakness of sterling. Really, too illiquid, and I'm unwinding the position. It did show a large loss. Probably worth having a continued modest exposure, but I won't be averaging down quite so aggressively in the future.

### Commodities

HG - this is a bet on the global economy, especially emerging markets, recovering. Copper has been very weak, but it has so many uses in the modern economy, and is not exposed to any particular geographical source of demand, I feel that it should not be so weak. 

### FX

Long EUR.USD - bullish on EUR, because EU following USA out of recession, but this not priced into equities or FX yet.

Long EUR.GBP - bullish on EUR, bearish on GBP, because of Britain's chronic twin deficits.

Short GBP.USD - bearish on GBP, as above. USD has strengthened, but will generally strengthen if the global economy grows, presumably\(!\).
