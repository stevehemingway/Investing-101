# Read Me

This is my attempt to write a book on investing.

I have decided to move back towards Markdown and also to re-focus the message of the book so it is more of a toolkit for investing action.

# The General Idea

This book is to tell you about how to take control of your savings. It is my attempt to record my successes, and failures as a private investor. It is a work in progress. If I have successes, may they inspire you. If I have failures, may some good come of them, as a guide how to avoid mistakes.

I do not claim to be a great expert on investing. However:

* I have been doing this for my own savings for a long time, and I felt that I'd learned some valuable lessons that I should share.

* I do do not want your money, unlike many of those who would offer you investment advice.

* Software really is eating the world, and nowhere more than in the finance industry. Tools that could be afforded only by traders in the biggest banks can now be used at no or nominal cost by private investors. There are even fewer reasons now to use a professional asset manager than there ever were in the past.

This book will  turn you into the next George Soros or John Paulson. It will not equip you to be convince anyone to fund your new hedge fund startup.  However, it should allow you to manage your own investments with confidence. Your performance should be good enough to outperform the  majority of fund managers. You will need to factor the extra time you spend researching, but you can offset this against your brokerage fees.
