# Investing-101

This is a book I'm creating on gitbook.com. This uses github as storage. You can view the book there, rather more conveniently than here.

I have worked in and around securities markets for a long time. For the last twenty years I've been investing my own money (and that of some close associates). I have made a lot of mistakes. I have learned a lot of things in the process. My goal in writing this book is to help you avoid these mistakes, and maybe to make some new ones of your own. With any luck they'll be less costly than mine, at least in percentage terms.


I had no intention of writing a book which is a comprehensive overview of how financial markets work. I include in the bibliography a range of my favourites, but this is a very incomplete list. My goal is to tell you the least you need to know to have a reasonable chance of losing your shirt when you start trading.


# What this book does not cover

Investing is spending money on any asset that is not immediately consumed. It is perfectly possible to invest in a car or a house. This book does not cover these sorts of investment decisions. It restricts itself entirely to investments in tradable securitie.
