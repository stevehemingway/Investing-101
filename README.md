# Investing-101

This is a book I'm creating on gitbook.com. This uses github as storage. You can view the book on GitHub or on GitBook. If you are on GitHub you'd be better off going to GitBook where the book can be accessed in all sorts of useful ways. The url to access the book there is:  <https://github.com/stevehemingway/Investing-101> (note that if you're reading this on GitBook, then this link is probably to the page where you're reading this.
