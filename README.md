# Read Me
This is my attempt to write a book on investing.

## 6 March  2016 
I have decided to move back towards Markdown and also to re-focus the message of the book so it is more of a toolkit for investing action. 

# Introduction

This book is to tell you about how to take control of your savings. 
It is not about selling you anything. I do not run seminars or residential courses. If you want to learn more you'll have to look at the books and websites in my bibliography.

I wrote this because:

* I have been doing this for my own savings for a long time, and I felt that I'd learned some valuable lessons that I should share.

* the industry that provides financial advice has become too conflicted by the opportunity to charge fees.

* the Internet really has changed everything, when it comes to investing, and there is really no need nowadays to rely on an expensive human financial advisor.


This book will  turn you into the next George Soros or John Paulson. It will not equip you to be convince anyone to fund your new hedge fund startup.  However, it should allow you to manage your own investments with confidence. Your performance should be good enough to outperform the  majority of fund managers. You will need to factor the extra time you spend researching, but you can offset this against your brokerage fees.
