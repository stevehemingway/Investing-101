## Trading Strategies

An old boss of mine used to say ''There are no such thing as problems,  
only opportunities''. I was not convinced about this, but in investing  
this may well be true: for most assets it’s easy to be on either side of  
the trade, so one man’s loss really is another man’s gain.
