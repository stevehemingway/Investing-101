# January 2016

The first days of January were a body blow to me as an investor. 
In late 2015 I had read a large number of articles predicting the course of 2016, but none of them came close to describing the carnage that the slowdown in China would wreak on developed market equities.

I am not sure what the cause of all this is. 
Circuit breakers fired when stocks fell by 7% in Shanghai. 
New regulations prohibiting institutional investors from shorting stocks seemed to be part of the cause. 
Sagging prices of commodities convinced everyone that forecasts of good global growth were illusory, in spite of good figures coming out of the US. 
My view, for what it is worth, is that downward price pressure is at least as much caused by increased supply as decreased demand, but it really is hard to prove. 
Certainly Iran being able to sell, Saudi desperate to increase government revenues, and even the Lybians managing to get some oil to market all boosted supply.
