# January 2016

The first days of January were a body blow to me as an investor. 
In late 2015 I had read a large number of articles predicting the course of 2016, but none of them came close to describing the carnage that the slowdown in China would wreak on developed market equities.

I am not sure what the cause of all this is. 
Circuit breakers fired when stocks fell by 7% in Shanghai. 
New regulations prohibiting institutional investors from shorting stocks seemed to be part of the cause. 
Sagging prices of commodities convinced everyone that forecasts of good global growth were illusory, in spite of good figures coming out of the US. 
My view, for what it is worth, is that downward price pressure is at least as much caused by increased supply as decreased demand, but it really is hard to prove. 
Certainly Iran being able to sell, Saudi desperate to increase government revenues, and even the Lybians managing to get some oil to market all boosted supply.

I have too many positions open at the moment. Here is the complete list (excluding currency positions):

I spent a lot of time on Seeking Alpha trying to find some ludicrously overvalued equities to offset my heavily long index exposure. 
I found a few, but making money by a genuine Alfred Jones hedge equity strategy is very hard work. 
I am writing this on 10 Jan, which is the first day that markets have rallied a bit. 
Probably too late in the day, I decided to buy some protection against further falls in oil prices.
The market seems to behave as if oil prices are a barometer of world demand, as copper used to be.
My short position in CL has helped to protect me against fairly weak performance today.

My long Treasury Notes/short Bunds has not been outstanding, but at least my hedged exposure to global interest rates has been better than it might have been had I just shorted Bunds.
