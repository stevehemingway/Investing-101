Investing-101
-------------

I have read many books on investing, but none of them really fully prepared me to trade securities and avoid losing money.
I am writing the book that I wish I had read when I started seriously investing in the mid 1990s.
This is a very early draft of the book. 

I have decided to write it on  http://www.gitbook.com[gitbook.com]. 
This is a very neat website that uses [http://www.github.com]github as storage.
At the moment I've decided to use the free GitHub service, which means that I must share my 
work with the world. You can view the book both on GitHub and GitBook. 
If you are on GitHub you'll have a better experience by going to GitBook where the book can be accessed in
all sorts of useful ways.
