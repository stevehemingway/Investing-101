# The Golden Rule: buy low, sell high 

All investors worry about their exit: converting their paper gains to real assets. For the trader, the exit is the closing of his position, which converts his unrealized profit to a realized profit.

This rule works whether you buy first, or sell first.  If you sell first, this is called _short selling_. It is particularly easy to do this with futures.

## Valuation

How do you know the price is low if you don't have a view on what it should be? The sorts of  securities we will be selling will be widely held. Presumably most holders are very happy to hold on to their stock of securities (their holdings or position)
 
Each investor will have a value to him of 

$$\sum_{i} Exp(pv_i ) $$

where $$pv_i = c_i d_i$$ and $$d_i = d(t_i)$$ and the expectation is formed over the probability distribution for receiving $$c_i$$ at time $$t_i$$. 

The problem therefore boils down to finding the distribution, $$p_i$$, and, to a lesser extend, the risk-free discount factor $$d(t)$$. Because it is so difficult to estimate the distribution, an approximation is often made to just discount the cashflows at a larger discount factor that incorporates both a time element, and risk element, perhaps derived from the cashflows of similarly risky assets.

You may be relieved to read that these mathematical formulations are largely useless. This is because you are substituting one problem: establishing a correct price, for another: constructing a probability distribution.

Note that the discount factor for risk free cashflows reflects the individual investor's time value of money. [In practice we ignore this: is this reasonable? If someone had a different time preference, would this really affect valuations?]

# The importance of securities exchanges

The nexus where buyers and sellers meet and prices are most easily discovered.

# Stock Exchanges

Deliver price visibility, and, sometimes, settlement services. 

A marketplace, where buyers and sellers come together to assist price discovery. These days usually coming together in a strictly electronic sense. 

Will usually collect bids and offers from participants. Sometimes with specialists, who enjoy certain privileges in exchange for providing liquidity. 

Securities exchanges often work to reduce the delivery risk to buyers and sellers by providing some structured settlement system by ensuring transfer of title against payment. They will always attempt to standardize securities. Without standardizing contracts selling and buying become enormously more expensive. God gave us wheat, but the Chicago Board of Trade gave us _No. 2 Soft Red Winter Wheat_ .




# Futures Exchanges

The most basic derivative. Has existed for hundreds of years to meet the demand for farmers to remove risk of an adverse movement in grain prices. A farmer can sell his grain, to remove his risk of the price going down, and a baker can buy this grain, to remove the risk of the price going up. The contract specifies a standard of wheat, and a delivery date. The exchange removes the credit risk that would otherwise exist. Both parties have the exchange as their counter-party. By insisting on all parties providing collateral, the exchange can insulate itself from credit risk. By never entering into a one-sided deal, the exchange isolates itself from market risk.


# Options Exchanges

# Brokers

Exchanges have systems that cannot be accessed directly by end investors. Diversification is important, and having good access to as many exchanges is necessary to get good diversification. Most brokers concentrate in one geographical area (e.g. UK or USA), or in one product area (like futures and options). Many struggle to develop systems which are truly multi-currency. Brokers are supposed to have protocols in place to minimize credit risk: you, as a trader, do not trade with them as a counterparty: they are your agent.

In the area of futures traders, there have been some spectacular failures: MF Global, and Saxo Spreads. Brokers tend to fail at a time of maximum market volatility: the very last time you want to try to change brokers, and take the risk of liquidating and re-establishing a position.

I have found that a good place to start is [Barron's Survey of Online Brokerages](http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB51367578116875004693704580500193983582362). I personally use Interactive Brokers. They are fairly sophisticated, and are the best that I've come across. Previously I was with Options Xpress, a very good brokerage, owned by Charles Schwab, but one that now focuses almost exclusively on clients based in the USA. My experience is that US-based brokerages are many years ahead of UK or European providers in terms of technology and breadth of product coverage.
