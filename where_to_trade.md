# The Golden Rule: buy low, sell high 

All investors worry about their exit: converting their paper gains to real assets. For the trader, the exit is the closing of his position, which converts his unrealized profit to a realized profit.

This rule works if the order in which the buying and selling takes place is reversed, but to make this work you have to find someone willing to lend you the asset to start the strategy, which is easy for futures, but often harder for cash instruments.

## The importance of valuation

How do you know the price is low if you don't have a view on what it should be?

# The importance of securities exchanges

The nexus where buyers and sellers meet and prices are most easily discovered.

# Stock Exchanges

Deliver price visibility, and, sometimes, settlement services.

# Futures Exchanges

The most basic derivative. Has existed for hundreds of years to meet the demand for farmers to remove risk of an adverse movement in grain prices. A farmer can sell his grain, to remove his risk of the price going down, and a baker can buy this grain, to remove the risk of the price going up. The contract specifies a standard of wheat, and a delivery date. The exchange removes the credit risk that would otherwise exist. Both parties have the exchange as their counter-party. By insisting on all parties providing collateral, the exchange can insulate itself from credit risk. By never entering into a one-sided deal, the exchange isolates itself from market risk.
