# The Golden Rule: buy low, sell high 

All investors worry about their exit: converting their paper gains to real assets. For the trader, the exit is the closing of his position, which converts his unrealized profit to a realized profit.

This rule works whether you buy first, or sell first.  If you sell first, this is called _short selling_. It is particularly easy to do this with futures.

## The importance of valuation

How do you know the price is low if you don't have a view on what it should be? The sorts of  securities we will be selling will be widely held. Presumably most holders are very happy to hold on to their stock of securities (their holdings or position)
 
Each investor will have a value to him of 

$$\[\sum_{i} Exp(pv_i ) \]$$

where $$pv_i = c_i d_i$$ and $$d_i = d(t_i)$$ and the expectation is formed over the probability distribution for receiving $$c_i$$ at time $$t_i$$. 

The problem therefore boils down to finding the distribution, $$p_i$$, and, to a lesser extend, the risk-free discount factor $$d(t)$$. Because it is so difficult to estimate the distribution, an approximation is often made to just discount the cashflows at a larger discount factor that incorporates both a time element, and risk element, perhaps derived from the cashflows of similarly risky assets.

You may be relieved to read that these mathematical formulations are largely useless. This is because you are substituting one problem: establishing a correct price, for another: constructing a probability distribution.

Note that the discount factor for risk free cashflows reflects the individual investor's time value of money. [In practice we ignore this: is this reasonable? If someone had a different time preference, would this really affect valuations?]

# The importance of securities exchanges

The nexus where buyers and sellers meet and prices are most easily discovered.

# Stock Exchanges

Deliver price visibility, and, sometimes, settlement services.

# Futures Exchanges

The most basic derivative. Has existed for hundreds of years to meet the demand for farmers to remove risk of an adverse movement in grain prices. A farmer can sell his grain, to remove his risk of the price going down, and a baker can buy this grain, to remove the risk of the price going up. The contract specifies a standard of wheat, and a delivery date. The exchange removes the credit risk that would otherwise exist. Both parties have the exchange as their counter-party. By insisting on all parties providing collateral, the exchange can insulate itself from credit risk. By never entering into a one-sided deal, the exchange isolates itself from market risk.
