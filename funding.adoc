# Funding

This is based on some advice I gave to a couple of friends who are contemplating borrowing to buy a house.
It is written in a personal style which is not in line with the rest of the book.
Possibly the rest of the book should be changed to this style.

I think the way the market works is that one bank offers the most attractive deal until loans reach a prescribed target, and then they increase the rate, or in some other way make the loan less attractive in some other way to choke off demand. When Ali's brothers were looking at this a year or two ago it seemed that The Woolwich, which is part of Barclays, was offering the best deal, which was around 2% above base rate, but things may have changed.

I am not an expert in this, but I have borrowed a lot in my time (and I am continuing to borrow more), so I have spent a lot of time looking for the best deal. My conclusions are, in no particular order:
it's not necessary to go to a broker to get the best deal. My cheapest loans were obtained by going straight to the Skipton. I had done my research on the internet and they appeared to offer the best rate, and now, fourteen years later, I am still convinced this was the cheapest lender (unfortunately they no longer offer commercial lending: what's a good deal for the borrower is a bad deal for the lender). My view is that brokers still face conflicts of interest, and that the best loan for you is very unlikely to be the most rewarding for the broker ('adviser'). Some brokers may be able to disregard such perverse incentives, but my guess it that most cannot. 
it's very important to get a long-term loan, say 25 years, even if you do not see yourself owning the property for this period. Redemption penalties after the first couple of years are usually minimal. If it turns out that your borrowing is cheap compared to what is available in the market in the future, you can hang onto to your loan. If better deals are available, you can redeem it at low cost. You should check the redemption penalties carefully though. They are typically equivalent to 3 months' interest cost. Any more and you should steer clear of the mortgage.
*probably* it's best to get a 'floating rate' loan. This means that as inflation picks up (if it does) your mortgage interest cost will rise, but so will your salary, and the capital value of your house, so the increased cost is unlikely to hurt much. Beware that there is a possibility that inflation will spiral out of control and you'll have to pay interest at 20%. Thisseems a rather remote possibility at the moment, but it should be borne in mind. 

If you are very risk averse, you could go for a fixed rate. There have been reported sightings of the 25-year fixed rate mortgage (which, at least until recently, was a pretty standard product in the USA), e.g. http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-2191621/Are-brave-The-25-year-fixed-mortgage-returns.html[this article from the website thisismoney.co.uk], but there are very few lenders.  This is a result of government policy, as longer-term fixed rate assets (i.e. mortgages) force banks to hold more capital.

In practice it is very difficult to manage to borrow for anything like a 25-year term though, and even if you could get it, it would look expensive, compared to current floating rate products.
Lenders put an enormous amount of effort in being creative and thinking up all sorts of extra fees and charges to boost the profitability of their lending. These can add up to several years of interest cost, which seems to be totally outrageous, but it is very hard to escape them altogether. The smaller building societies are likely to be less rapacious about this. 

There are various administration fees, brokerage commissions, 'deed fees', processing fees, &c &c which bear no relation to the lenders' actual cost. You can see I am not a fan of mortgage lenders' operating model.
you should avoid all pension mortgages, endowment mortgages, and interest-only mortgages. These exist to boost broker's commissions.

You should *definitely* avoid foreign currency mortgages. I think these have dropped out of favour, but used to be quite popular,
you should look very closely at all 'teaser rate' mortgages, where you pay one rate for an initial period (e.g. 3 years) and then the rate reverts to some 'standard' (i.e. expensive) rate at the end of the period. The typical product is a reasonable fixed rate for 3 or 5 years with a reversion to the lender's 'Standard Variable Rate' mortgage at the end of the period. If everything goes well, these are a good idea, because with any luck, you'll have more equity after the fixed term, which will allow you to refinance at a new, cheap rate. If everything doesn't go well, then your problems are compounded. If your equity has shrunk, or become negative, you will be locked into a high rate, which can get out of hand. 
Borrowing a product like this offends the fundamental rule of keeping a margin of safety away from very bad scenarios.

You should *definitely* avoid the building structure insurance that that you can get by ticking the box on the mortgage application form. My experience is that  this is likely to be at least twice as expensive as equivalent insurance you could get elsewhere. It is deeply depressing that banks and building societies engage in this unfair, but profitable, practice still.
The same goes for any life insurance that you are obliged to take out alongside the loan,
the most important single number, if you plan to keep your property and your mortgage for a reasonably long interval (~10 years), is the spread over base rate. My preferred base rate is LIBOR (which, now, everyone has heard of), but normally you'll have to settle for a, slightly vaguely defined, 'base rate'. Historically this has been the Bank of England deposit rate, but gives the lender the option of severing that connection if it gets into trouble. You should try to get a rate of no more than 1.9% over base. You should choose 'tracker' and 'no initial period' in these comparison sites. I attach a quick search I did, but you probably can find a better deal from a smaller lender who doesn't want to pay the fees to appear on a site like this. Note that the best rate will be associated with the lowest LTV. This is simply a reflection of the reduced risk that the lender is taking.
