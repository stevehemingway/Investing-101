What is risk?
-------------

Risk: something that can be insured because the set of possible future
outcomes is denumerable. In trading we probably will use `hedge' rather
than `insure'. Uncertainty: outcomes that are not envisageable. An
example would be your house not burning down, but being lifted into
space by aliens. The latter is definitely something that it would be
impossible to get a quote on.

Tail risk: Nassim Taleb.
