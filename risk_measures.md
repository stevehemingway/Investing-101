# What is risk?

Risk: something that can be insured  because the set of possible future outcomes is denumerable. In trading we probably will use 'hedge' rather than 'insure'.  Uncertainty:  outcomes that are not envisageable. An example would be  your house not burning down, but being lifted into space by aliens. The latter is definitely something that it would be impossible to get a quote on.

Tail risk: Nassim Taleb.
